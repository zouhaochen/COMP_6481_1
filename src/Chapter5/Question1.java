package Chapter5;

/*
You operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town.
Define a class named HotDogStand that has an instance variable for the hot dog standâ€™s ID number and
an instance variable for how many hot dogs the stand has sold that day.
Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values.
Also create a method named justSold that increments by one the number of hot dogs the stand has sold.
The idea is that this method will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog so that
you can track the total number of hot dogs sold by the stand.
Add another method that returns the number of hot dogs sold.
Finally, add a static variable that tracks the total number of hot dogs sold by all hot dog stands and
a static method that returns the value in this variable.
Write a main method to test your class with at least three hot dog stands that each sell a variety of hot dogs.
