/*
You are interested in keeping track of the team members and
competition information for your schoolâ€™s annual entries in computer science programming competitions.
Each team consists of exactly four team members. Every year your team competes in two competitions.
As an initial start for your database, create a class named Team that has the following instance variables:
Note that there is a much better way to represent the team members and competitions using arrays;
this is covered in a subsequent chapter.
The class should also have a method that outputs all the names of all team members and
the competition information to the console.
