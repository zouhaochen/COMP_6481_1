/*
A common memory matching game played by young children is to start with
a deck of cards that contain identical pairs.
For example, given six cards inn the deck, two might be labeled 1, two labeled 2, and two labeled 3.
The card are shuffled and placed face down on the table.
A player then selects two cards that are face down, turns them face up,
and if the cards match, they are left face up.
If the two cards do not match, they are returned to their original face down position.
The game continues until all cards are face up.

Write a program that plays the memory matching game. Use 16 cards that are laid out in a 4*4 square
and are labeled with pairs of numbers from 1 to 8.
Your program should allow the player to specify the cards that
he or she would like to select through a coordinate system.
