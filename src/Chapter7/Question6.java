/*
Create a class called Vehicle that has the manufacturerâ€™s name (type String ),
number of cylinders in the engine (type int ), and owner (type Person given next).
Then, create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has the following additional properties:
the load capacity in tons (type double since it may contain a fractional part)
and towing capacity in pounds (type int ).
Be sure your class has a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor and mutator methods,
and suitably defined equals and toString methods. Write a program to test all your methods.
