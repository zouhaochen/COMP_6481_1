// A powerful OOP tool is the use of abstract classes/methods to
// create "templates" for classes. We can add one of more abstract
// methods and then provide the method bodies in the subclasses.
// subclasses are then free to create completely different implementations.

// our farm test class. We create two animals and have them say Hello.
